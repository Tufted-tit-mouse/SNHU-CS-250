How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I personally think that the best way to gather user needs is through things like interviews, surveys, observation, and feedback. By gathering this type of information it is easier to create user stories. These user stories help by giving a brief understanding of what the client is wanting and how I can achieve that. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by starting with the requirements and what the program needs to accomplish. I hope to incorporate the majority of the scrum framework. This type of work can be hard for a solo developer to incorporate but with things like incremental development (similar to sprints) it might make things easier. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member contributes, is held accountable to the work they complete, is adaptable to events and circumstances, and has respect and empathy for their teammates!
